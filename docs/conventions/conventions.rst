===========

This page lists the Zarr conventions. The proposal to formalise the conventions is introduced in `ZEP0004 <https://zarr.dev/zeps/draft/ZEP0004.html>`_.

Some of the widely used conventions are:

- `GDAL <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/zarr.html>`_
- `OME-NGFF <https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/>`_
- `NCZarr <https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/nczarr_head.html>`_
- `Xarray <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/internals/zarr-encoding-spec.html>`_

Any new conventions accepted by the `ZEP <https://zarr.dev/zeps/active/ZEP0000.html>`_ process will be listed here.
