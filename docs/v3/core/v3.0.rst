Abstract
========

This specification defines the Zarr format for N-dimensional typed arrays.


Status of this document
=======================

.. warning::
    This document is a draft for review and subject to changes.
    It will become final when the `Zarr Enhancement Proposal (ZEP) 1 <https://zarr.dev/zeps/draft/ZEP0001.html>`_
    is approved via the `ZEP process <https://zarr.dev/zeps/active/ZEP0000.html>`_.


Introduction
============

This specification defines a format for multidimensional array data. This
type of data is common in scientific and numerical computing
applications. Many domains are facing computational challenges as
increasingly large volumes of data are being generated, for example,
via high resolution microscopy, remote sensing imagery, genome
sequencing or numerical simulation. The primary motivation for the
development of Zarr has been to help address this challenge by
enabling the storage of large multidimensional arrays in a way that is
compatible with parallel and/or distributed computing applications.

This specification is intended to supersede the `Zarr storage
specification version 2
<https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/v2.html>`_ (Zarr v2). The
Zarr v2 specification has been implemented in several programming
languages and has been used successfully to store and analyse large
scientific datasets from a variety of domains. However, as experience
has been gained, it has become clear that there are several
opportunities for modest but useful improvements to be made in the
format, and for establishing a foundation that allows for greater
interoperability, whilst also enabling a variety of more advanced and
specialised features to be explored and developed.

This specification also draws heavily on the `N5 API and
file-system specification <https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5>`_, which
was developed in parallel to Zarr v2 and has many of the same design
goals and features. This specification defines a core set of features
at the intersection of both Zarr v2 and N5, and so aims to provide a
common target that can be fully implemented across multiple
programming environments and serve a wide range of applications.

In particular, we highlight the following areas motivating the
development of this specification.

Extensibility
-------------

The development of systems for storage of very large array-like data
is a very active area of research and development, and there are many
possibilities that remain to be explored. A goal of this specification
is to define a format with a number of clear extension points and
mechanisms, in order to provide a framework for freely building on and
exploring these possibilities. We aim to make this possible, whilst
also providing pathways for a graceful degradation of functionality
where possible, in order to retain interoperability. We also aim to
provide a framework for community-defined extensions, which can be
developed and published independently without requiring centralised
coordination of all specifications.

See :ref:`extension points <extensions_section>` below.

Interoperability
----------------

While the Zarr v2 and N5 specifications have each been implemented in
multiple programming languages, there is currently not feature parity
across all implementations. This is in part because the feature set
includes some features that are not easily translated or supported
across different programming languages. This specification aims to
define a set of core features that are useful and sufficient to
address a significant fraction of use cases, but are also
straightforward to implement fully across different programming
languages. Additional functionality can then be layered via
extensions, some of which may aim for wide adoption, some of which may
be more specialised and have more limited implementation.


Stability Policy
----------------

This core specification adheres to a ``MAJOR.MINOR`` version
number format. When incrementing the minor version, only additional features
can be added. Breaking changes require to increment the major version.

A zarr implementation that provides the read and write API by
implementing a specification ``X.Y`` can be considered compatible with all
datasets which only use features contained in version ``X.Y``.

For example, spec ``X.1`` adds core feature "foo" compared to ``X.0``. Assuming
implementation A implements ``X.0`` and implementation B implements ``X.1``.
Data using feature "foo" can only be read with implementation A. B fails to open
it, as the key "foo" is unknown.

Data not using "foo" can be used with both implementations, even if it's written
with implementation B.

Therefore, data is only marked with the respective major version, unknown
features are auto-discovered via the metadata document.

Notably, this excludes extension points such as codecs, data types, chunk grids
and storage transformers from the compatibility of the core specification, as
well as store support. However, versioned extension points and stores are also
expected to follow this stability policy.

Document conventions
====================

Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
descriptive assertions and [RFC2119]_ terminology. The key words
"MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative
parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC2119]_. However, for readability, these words do not appear in all
uppercase letters in this specification.

All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. Examples in
this specification are introduced with the words "for example".

Concepts and terminology
========================

This section introduces and defines some key terms and explains the
conceptual model underpinning the Zarr format.

The following figure illustrates the first part of the terminology:

.. image:: terminology-hierarchy.excalidraw.png
  :width: 600

.. _hierarchy:

*Hierarchy*

    A Zarr hierarchy is a tree structure, where each node in the tree
    is either a group_ or an array_. Group nodes may have children but
    array nodes may not. All nodes in a hierarchy have a name_ and a
    path_. The root of a Zarr hierarchy may be either a group_ or an array_.
    In the latter case, the hierarchy consists of just the single array.

.. _array:
.. _arrays:

*Array*

    An array is a node in a hierarchy_. An array is a data structure
    with zero or more dimensions_ whose lengths define the shape_ of
    the array. An array contains zero or more data elements_. All
    elements_ in an array conform to the same `data type`_. An array
    may not have child nodes.

.. _group:
.. _groups:

*Group*

    A group is a node in a hierarchy_ that may have child nodes.

.. _name:
.. _names:

*Name*

    Each child node of a group has a name, which is a string of
    characters with some additional constraints defined in the section
    on `node names`_ below.  Two sibling nodes cannot have the same
    name.

.. _path:
.. _paths:

*Path*

    Each node in a hierarchy_ has a path, a Unicode string that uniquely
    identifies the node and defines its location within the hierarchy_. The root
    node has a path of ``/``.  The path of a non-root node is equal the
    concatenation of:

    - the path of its parent node;
    - the ``/`` character, unless the parent is the root node;
    - the name_ of the node itself.

    For example, the path ``"/foo/bar"`` identifies a node named ``"bar"``,
    whose parent is named ``"foo"``, whose parent is the root of the hierarchy.

    A path always starts with ``/``, and a non-root path cannot end with ``/``,
    because node names_ must be non-empty and cannot contain ``/``.

.. _dimension:
.. _dimensions:

*Dimension*

    An array_ has a fixed number of zero or more dimensions. Each dimension has
    an integer length. This specification only considers the case where the
    lengths of all dimensions are finite. However,
    :ref:`extensions<extensions_section>` may be defined which allow a dimension
    to have an infinite or variable length.

.. _shape:

*Shape*

    The shape of an array_ is the tuple of dimension_ lengths. For
    example, if an array_ has 2 dimensions_, where the length of the
    first dimension_ is 100 and the length of the second dimension_ is
    20, then the shape of the array_ is (100, 20). A shape can be the empty
    tuple in the case of zero-dimension arrays (scalar)

.. _element:
.. _elements:

*Element*

    An array_ contains zero or more elements. Each element can be
    identified by a tuple of integer coordinates, one for each
    dimension_ of the array_. If all dimensions_ of an array_ have
    finite length, then the number of elements in the array_ is given
    by the product of the dimension_ lengths.

.. _data type:

*Data type*

    A data type defines the set of possible values that an array_ may
    contain, and a default binary representation (i.e., sequence of bytes) for
    each possible value. For example, the 32-bit signed
    integer data type defines binary representations for all integers
    in the range −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. This specification
    only defines a limited set of data types, but extensions
    may define other data types.

.. _chunk:
.. _chunks:

*Chunk*

    An array_ is divided into a set of chunks, where each chunk is a
    hyperrectangle defined by a tuple of intervals, one for each
    dimension_ of the array_. The chunk shape is the tuple of interval
    lengths, and the chunk size (i.e., number of elements_ contained
    within the chunk) is the product of its interval lengths.

    The chunk shape elements are non-zero when the corresponding dimensions of
    the arrays are of non-zero length.

.. _grid:
.. _grids:

*Grid*

    The chunks_ of an array_ are organised into a grid. This
    specification only considers the case where all chunks_ have the
    same chunk shape and the chunks form a regular grid. However,
    extensions may define other grid types such as
    rectilinear grids.

.. _codec:
.. _codecs:

*Codec*

    The list of *codecs* specified for an array_ determine the encoded byte
    representation of each chunk in the store_.

.. _metadata document:
.. _metadata documents:

*Metadata document*

    Each array_ in a hierarchy_ is represented by a metadata document,
    which is a machine-readable document containing essential
    processing information about the node. For example, an array_
    metadata document will specify the number of dimensions_, shape_,
    `data type`_, grid_, and codec_ for that array_.

    Groups can have an optional metadata document which provides extra
    information about a group.

.. _store:
.. _stores:

*Store*

    The `metadata documents`_ and encoded chunk_ data for all nodes in a
    hierarchy_ are held in a store as raw bytes. To enable a variety
    of different store types to be used, this specification defines an
    `Abstract store interface`_ which is a common set of operations that stores
    may provide. For example, a directory in a file system can be a zarr store,
    where keys are file names, values are file contents, and files can be read,
    written, listed or deleted via the operating system. Equally, an S3 bucket
    can provide this interface, where keys are resource names, values are
    resource contents, and resources can be read, written or deleted via HTTP.

.. _storage transformer:
.. _storage transformers:

*Storage transformer*

    To provide performance enhancements or other optimizations,
    storage transformers may intercept and alter the storage keys and bytes
    of an array_ before they reach the underlying physical storage.
    Upon retrieval, the original keys and bytes are restored within the
    transformer. Any number of predefined storage transformers can be
    registered and stacked. In contrast to codecs, storage transformers can
    act on the a complete array, rather than individual chunks. See the
    `storage transformers details`_ below.

.. _`storage transformers details`:

The following figure illustrates the codec, store and storage transformer
terminology for a use case of reading from an array:

  :width: 600

.. _stored-representation:

Stored representation
=====================

A Zarr hierarchy_ is represented by the following set of key/value entries in an
underlying store_:

- The array_ or group_ metadata document for the root of a Zarr hierarchy_ is
  stored under the key ``zarr.json``.

- The metadata document of a non-root array or group with hierarchy path ``P``
  is obtained by stripping the leading ``/`` of the path and appending
  ``/zarr.json``.  For example, the metadata document of an array or group with
  path ``/foo/bar`` is ``foo/bar/zarr.json``.

- All chunk or other data of an array is stored under the key prefix determined
  by its path.  For a root array, the key prefix is obtained from the metadata
  document key by stripping the trailing ``zarr.json``.  For example, for a root
  array, the prefix is the empty string.  For a non-root array with hierarchy
  path ``/foo/bar``, the prefix is ``foo/bar/``.

.. note::

   When storing a Zarr hierachy in a filesystem-like store (e.g. the local
   filesystem or S3) as a sub-directory, it is recommended that the
   sub-directory name ends with ``.zarr`` to indicate the start of a hierarchy
   to users.

.. _metadata:

Metadata
========

This section defines the structure of metadata documents for Zarr hierarchies,
which consists of two types of metadata documents: array metadata documents, and
group metadata documents. Both types of metadata documents are stored under the
key ``zarr.json`` within the prefix of the array or group.  Each type of
metadata document is described in the following subsections.

Metadata documents are defined here using the JSON
type system defined in [RFC8259]_. In this section, the terms "value",
"number", "string" and "object" are used to denote the types as
defined in [RFC8259]_. The term "array" is also used as defined in
[RFC8259]_, except where qualified as "Zarr array". Following
[RFC8259]_, this section also describes an object as a set of
name/value pairs. This section also defines how metadata documents are
encoded for storage.

.. _array-metadata:

Array metadata
--------------

Each Zarr array in a hierarchy must have an array metadata document, named
``zarr.json``. This document must contain a single object with the following
mandatory names:

``zarr_format``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    An integer defining the version of the storage specification to which the
    array store adheres, must be ``3`` here.

``node_type``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    A string defining the type of hierarchy node element, must be ``array``
    here.

``shape``
^^^^^^^^^

    An array of integers providing the length of each dimension of the
    Zarr array. For example, a value ``[10, 20]`` indicates a
    two-dimensional Zarr array, where the first dimension has length
    10 and the second dimension has length 20.

``data_type``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The data type of the Zarr array. If the data type is defined in
    this specification, then the value must be the data type
    identifier provided as a string. For example, ``"float64"`` for
    little-endian 64-bit floating point number.

    The ``data_type`` value is an extension point and may be defined by a data
    type extension. If the data type is defined by an extension, then the value
    must be an object containing the names ``name`` and optionally
    ``configuration`` and ``fallback``. The ``name`` is required and its value
    must refer to a v3 data type specification. ``configuration`` is optional
    and its value is defined by the extension. The ``fallback`` is optional and,
    if provided, its value must be one or a list of the data type identifiers
    defined in this specification or an extension. Fallback extension datatypes
    are specified as an object with ``name`` and (optionally) ``configuration``.

    If an implementation does not recognise the extension or specific data type,
    but a ``fallback`` is present, then the implementation may proceed using the
    first known ``fallback`` value as the data type. For fixed-sized data types,
    if there is no more specific fallback available, a raw number of bytes using
    the raw type (``r*``) should be given.

    The default list of fallbacks to put into the metadata should by defined by
    the data type extension, but it may be overridden by the user. *Note for
    implementations*: Silently using a fallback without explicit approval might
    cause problems for users, please consider options to (de-)activate fallback
    behavior and/or appropriate warnings.

``chunk_grid``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The chunk grid of the Zarr array. If the chunk grid is a regular chunk grid
    as defined in this specification, then the value must be an object with the
    names ``name`` and ``configuration``. The value of ``name`` must be the
    string ``"regular"``, and the value of ``configuration`` an object with the
    member ``chunk_shape``. ``chunk_shape`` must be an array of
    integers providing the lengths of the chunk along each dimension of the
    array.  For example,
    ``{"name": "regular", "configuration": {"chunk_shape": [2, 5]}}``
    means a regular grid where the chunks have length 2 along the first
    dimension and length 5 along the second dimension.

    The ``chunk_grid`` value is an extension point and may be defined by an
    extension. If the chunk grid type is defined by an extension, then ``name``
    must be a string referring to a v3 chunk grid specification. The
    ``configuration`` is optional and defined by the extension.

``chunk_key_encoding``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The mapping from chunk grid cell coordinates to keys in the underlying
    store.

    The value must be an object with required string member ``name``, specifying
    the encoding type, and optional member ``configuration`` specifying encoding
    type-dependent parameters; the ``configuration`` value must be an object if
    it is specified.

    The following encodings are defined:

    - ``default``

      The ``configuration`` object may contain one optional member,
      ``separator``, which must be either ``"/"`` or ``"."``.  If not specified,
      ``separator`` defaults to ``"/"``.

      The key for a chunk with grid index (``k``, ``j``, ``i``, ...) is
      formed by taking the initial prefix ``c``, and appending for each dimension:

      - the ``separator`` character, followed by,

      - the ASCII decimal string representation of the chunk index within that dimension.

      For example, in a 3 dimensional array, with a separator of ``/`` the identifier
      for the chunk at grid index (1, 23, 45) is the string ``"c/1/23/45"``.  With a
      separator of ``.``, the identifier is the string ``"c.1.23.45"``.

      .. note:: A main difference with spec v2 is that the default chunk separator
         changed from ``.`` to ``/``, as in N5.  This decreases the maximum number of
         items in hierarchical stores like directory stores.

      .. note:: Arrays may have 0 dimensions (when for example representing scalars),
         in which case the coordinate of a chunk is the empty tuple, and the chunk key
         will consist of the string ``c``.

    - ``v2``

      The ``configuration`` object may contain one optional member,
      ``separator``, which must be either ``"/"`` or ``"."``.  If not specified,
      ``separator`` defaults to ``"."``.

      The identifier for chunk with at least one dimension is formed by
      concatenating for each dimension:

      - the ASCII decimal string representation of the chunk index within that
        dimension, followed by

      - the ``separator`` character, except that it is omitted for the last
        dimension.

      For example, in a 3 dimensional array, with a separator of ``.`` the identifier
      for the chunk at grid index (1, 23, 45) is the string ``"1.23.45"``.  With a
      separator of ``/``, the identifier is the string ``"1/23/45"``.

      For chunk grids with 0 dimensions, the single chunk has the key ``"0"``.

      .. note::

         This encoding is intended only to allow existing v2 arrays to be
         converted to v3 without having to rename chunks.  It is not recommended
         to be used when writing new arrays.

``fill_value``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Provides an element value to use for uninitialised portions of the
    Zarr array.

    If the data type of the Zarr array is Boolean then the value must
    be the literal ``false`` or ``true``. If the data type is one of
    the integer data types defined in this specification, then the
    value must be a number with no fraction or exponent part and must
    be within the range of the data type.

    For any data type, the ``fill_value`` is required. The literal
    ``null`` is not permitted. The fill value needs to be defined
    so that the data is independent of implementation details. Internally
    implementations may provide a default ``fill_value``, but that must
    be converted to a fixed value in the stored metadata.

    If the ``data_type`` of an array is defined in a ``data_type`` extension,
    then said extension is responsible for interpreting the value of
    ``fill_value`` and return a suitable type that can be used.

    For core data types for which fill values are not permitted in JSON or
    for which decimal representation could be lossy, a string representing of
    the binary (starting with ``0b``) or hexadecimal value (starting with
    ``0x``) is accepted. This string must include all leading or trailing
    zeroes necessary to match the given type size. The string values ``"NaN"``,
    ``"+Infinity"`` and ``"-Infinity"`` are also understood for floating point
    data types.


The following members are optional:

``attributes``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The value must be an object. The object may contain any key/value
    pairs, where the key must be a string and the value can be an arbitrary
    JSON literal. Intended to allow storage of arbitrary user metadata.


  .. note::
    An extension to store user attributes in a separate document is being
    discussed in https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/72.

  .. note::
    A proposal to specify metadata conventions (ZEP 4) is being discussed in
    https://github.com/zarr-developers/zeps/pull/28.

``codecs``
^^^^^^^^^^

    Specifies a list of codecs to be used for encoding and decoding chunks. The
    value must be an array of objects, each object containing a member with
    ``name`` whose value is a string referring to a v3 codec specification. The
    codec object may also contain a ``configuration`` object which consists of
    the parameter names and values as defined by the corresponding codec
    specification. An absent ``codecs`` member is equivalent to specifying an
    empty list of codecs.

.. _storage_transformers_array:

``storage_transformers``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Specifies a stack of `storage transformers`_. Each value in the list must be
    an object containing the names ``name`` and optionally ``configuration``.
    The ``name`` is required and the value must be a string referring to the
    extension. The object may also contain a ``configuration`` object which
    consists of the parameter names and values as defined by the corresponding
    storage transformer specification. When the ``storage_transformers`` name is
    absent no storage transformer is used, same for an empty list.

``dimension_names``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Specifies dimension names, e.g. ``["x", "y", "z"]``.  If specified, must be
    an array of strings or null objects with the same length as ``shape``.  An
    unnamed dimension is indicated by the null object.  If ``dimension_names`` is
    not specified, all dimensions are unnamed.

    For compatibility with zarr implementations and applications that support
    using dimension names to uniquely identify dimensions, it is recommended but
    not required that all non-null dimension names are distinct (no two
    dimensions have the same non-empty name).

    This specification also does not place any restrictions on the use of the
    same dimension name across multiple arrays within the same zarr hierarchy,
    but extensions or specific applications may do so.

The array metadata object must not contain any other names.
Those are reserved for future versions of this specification.
An implementation must fail to open zarr hierarchies, groups
or arrays with unknown metadata fields, with the exception of
objects with a ``"must_understand": false`` key-value pair.

For example, the array metadata JSON document below defines a
two-dimensional array of 64-bit little-endian floating point numbers,
with 10000 rows and 1000 columns, divided into a regular chunk grid where
each chunk has 1000 rows and 100 columns, and thus there will be 100
chunks in total arranged into a 10 by 10 grid. Within each chunk the
binary values are laid out in C contiguous order. Each chunk is
compressed using gzip compression prior to storage::

    {
        "zarr_format": 3,
        "node_type": "array",
        "shape": [10000, 1000],
        "dimension_names": ["rows", "columns"],
        "data_type": "float64",

            "name": "regular",

                "separator": "/"
            }
        },
        "codecs": [{
            "name": "gzip",
            "configuration": {
                "level": 1
            }
        }],
        "fill_value": "NaN",
        "extensions": [],
        "attributes": {
            "foo": 42,
            "bar": "apples",
            "baz": [1, 2, 3, 4]
        }
    }

The following example illustrates an array with the same shape and chunking as
above, but using a (currently made up) extension data type::

    {
        "zarr_format": 3,
        "node_type": "array",
        "shape": [10000, 1000],
        "data_type": {
            "name": "datetime",
            "configuration": {
                "unit": "ns"
            },
            "fallback": "int64"
        },
        "chunk_grid": {
            "name": "regular",
            "configuration": {
                "chunk_shape": [1000, 100]
            }
        },
        "chunk_key_encoding": {
            "name": "default",
            "configuration": {
                "separator": "/"
            }
        },
        "codecs": [{
            "name": "gzip",
            "configuration": {
                "level": 1
            }
        }],
        "fill_value": null,
    }

.. note::

   Comparison with zarr spec v2:

   - ``dtype`` has been renamed to ``data_type``,
   - the identifiers of data types has have been changed to ``uint8``, ``int16``, ``float32`` etc.,
   - endianness specification in ``dtype`` has been replaced by the :ref:`endian <endian-codec-v1>` codec,
   - ``chunks`` has been replaced with ``chunk_grid``,
   - ``dimension_separator`` has been replaced with ``chunk_key_encoding``,
   - ``order`` has been replaced by the :ref:`transpose <transpose-codec-v1>` codec,
   - the separate ``filters`` and ``compressor`` fields been combined into the single ``codecs`` field.

.. _group-metadata:

Group metadata
--------------

A Zarr group metadata object must contain the following mandatory key:

``zarr_format``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    An integer defining the version of the storage specification to which the
    array store adheres, must be ``3`` here.

``node_type``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    A string defining the type of hierarchy node element, must be ``group``
    here.

Optional keys:

``attributes``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The value must be an object. The object may contain any key/value
    pairs, where the key must be a string and the value can be an arbitrary
    JSON literal. Intended to allow storage of arbitrary user metadata.

For example, the JSON document below defines an explicit group::

    {
        "zarr_format": 3,
        "node_type": "group",
        "attributes": {
            "spam": "ham",
            "eggs": 42,
        }
    }

The group metadata object must not contain any other names. Those are reserved
for future versions of this specification. An implementation must fail to open
zarr hierarchies or groups with unknown metadata fields, with the exception of
objects with a ``"must_understand": false`` key-value pair.

.. note::

   A group does not need a metadata document to exist. (See implicit groups.)


Node names
==========

The root node does not have a name and is the empty string ``""``.
Except for the root node, each node in a hierarchy must have a name,
which is a string of unicode code points. The following constraints
apply to node names:

* must not be the empty string (``""``)
* must not include the character ``"/"``
* must not be a string composed only of period characters, e.g. ``"."`` or ``".."``
* must not start with the reserved prefix ``"__"``

To ensure consistent behaviour across different storage systems and programming
languages, we recommend users to only use characters in the sets ``a-z``,
``A-Z``, ``0-9``, ``-``, ``_``, ``.``.

Node names are case sensitive, e.g., the names "foo" and "FOO" are **not**
identical.

When using non-ASCII Unicode characters, we recommend users to use
case-folded NFKC-normalized strings following the
`General Security Profile for Identifiers of the Unicode Security Mechanisms (Unicode Technical Standard #39) <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#General_Security_Profile>`_.
This follows the
`Recommendations for Programmers (B) of the Unicode Security Considerations (Unicode Technical Report #36) <https://unicode.org/reports/tr36/#Recommendations_General>`_.

.. note::
    A storage transformer for unicode normalization might be added later, see
    https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/201.

.. note::
    The underlying store might pose additional restriction on node names,
    such as the following:

    * `260 characters path length limit in Windows <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation>`_
    * 1,024 bytes UTF8 object key limit for
      `AWS S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>`_
      and `GCS <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/objects#naming>`_, with
      additional constraints.
    * `Windows paths are case-insensitive by default <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions>`_
    * `MacOS paths are case-insensitive by default <https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/file-system-formats-dsku19ed921c/mac>`_

.. note::
    If a store requires an explicit byte string representation the default
    representation is the ``UTF-8`` encoded Unicode string.

.. note::
    The prefix ``__zarr`` is reserved for core zarr data, and extensions
    can use other files and folders starting with ``__``.


Data types
==========

A data type describes the set of possible binary values that an array
element may take, along with some information about how the values
should be interpreted.

This core specification defines a limited set of data types to
represent boolean values, integers, and floating point
numbers. Extensions may define additional data types. All of the data
types defined here have a fixed size, in the sense that all values
require the same number of bytes. However, extensions may define
variable sized data types.

Note that the Zarr specification is intended to enable communication
of data between a variety of computing environments. The native byte
order may differ between machines used to write and read the data.

Each data type is associated with an identifier, which can be used in
metadata documents to refer to the data type. For the data types
defined in this specification, the identifier is a simple ASCII
string. However, extensions may use any JSON value to identify a data
type.

   * - ``r*`` (Optional)
     - raw bits,  use for extension type fallbacks
     - variable, given by ``*``, is limited to be a multiple of 8.

Additionally to these base types, an implementation should also handle the
raw/opaque pass-through type designated by the lower-case letter ``r`` followed
by the number of bits, multiple of 8. For example, ``r8``, ``r16``, and ``r24``
should be understood as fall-back types of respectively 1, 2, and 3 byte length.

Zarr v3 is limited to type sizes that are a multiple of 8 bits but may support
other type sizes in later versions of this specification.

.. note::

   While the default binary representation is little endian, the :ref:`endian
   codec<endian-codec-v1>` may be specified to use big endian encoding instead.

.. note::

    We are explicitly looking for more feedback and prototypes of code using the ``r*``,
    raw bits, for various endianness and whether the spec could be made clearer.

.. note::

    Currently only fixed size elements are supported as a core data type.
    There are many request for variable length element encoding. There are many
    ways to encode variable length and we want to keep flexibility. While we seem
    to agree that for random access the most likely contender is to have two
    arrays, one with the actual variable length data and one with fixed size
    (pointer + length) to the variable size data, we do not want to commit to such
    a structure.
    See https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/62.


Chunk grids
===========

A chunk grid defines a set of chunks which contain the elements of an
array. The chunks of a grid form a tessellation of the array space,
which is a space defined by the dimensionality and shape of the
array. This means that every element of the array is a member of one
chunk, and there are no gaps or overlaps between chunks.

In general there are different possible types of grids. The core
specification defines the regular grid type, where all chunks are
hyperrectangles of the same shape. Extensions may define other grid
types, such as rectilinear grids where chunks are still
hyperrectangles but do not all share the same shape.

A grid type must also define rules for constructing an identifier for
each chunk that is unique within the grid, which is a string of ASCII
characters that can be used to construct keys to save and retrieve
chunk data in a store, see also the `Storage`_ section.

Regular grids
-------------

A regular grid is a type of grid where an array is divided into chunks
such that each chunk is a hyperrectangle of the same shape. The
dimensionality of the grid is the same as the dimensionality of the
array. Each chunk in the grid can be addressed by a tuple of positive
integers (`k`, `j`, `i`, ...) corresponding to the indices of the
chunk along each dimension.

The origin element of a chunk has coordinates in the array space (`k` *
`dz`, `j` * `dy`, `i` * `dx`, ...) where (`dz`, `dy`, `dx`, ...) are
the chunk sizes along each dimension.
Thus the origin element of the chunk at grid index (0, 0, 0,
...) is at coordinate (0, 0, 0, ...) in the array space, i.e., the
grid is aligned with the origin of the array. If the length of any
array dimension is not perfectly divisible by the chunk length along
the same dimension, then the grid will overhang the edge of the array
space.

The shape of the chunk grid will be (ceil(`z` / `dz`), ceil(`y` /
`dy`), ceil(`x` / `dx`), ...)  where (`z`, `y`, `x`, ...) is the array
shape, "/" is the division operator and "ceil" is the ceiling
function. For example, if a 3 dimensional array has shape (10, 200,
3000), and has chunk shape (5, 20, 400), then the shape of the chunk
grid will be (2, 10, 8), meaning that there will be 2 chunks along the
first dimension, 10 along the second dimension, and 8 along the third
dimension.

.. list-table:: Regular Grid Example
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Array Shape
      - Chunk Shape
      - Chunk Grid Shape
      - Notes
    * - (10, 200, 3000)
      - (5, 20, 400)
      - (2, 10, 8)
      - The grid does overhang the edge of the array on the 3rd dimension.

An element of an array with coordinates (`c`, `b`, `a`, ...) will
occur within the chunk at grid index (`c` // `dz`, `b` // `dy`, `a` //
`dx`, ...), where "//" is the floor division operator. The element
will have coordinates (`c` % `dz`, `b` % `dy`, `a` % `dx`, ...) within
that chunk, where "%" is the modulo operator. For example, if a
3 dimensional array has shape (10, 200, 3000), and has chunk shape
(5, 20, 400), then the element of the array with coordinates (7, 150, 900)
is contained within the chunk at grid index (1, 7, 2) and has coordinates
(2, 10, 100) within that chunk.

The store key corresponding to a given grid cell is determined based on the
`chunk_key_encoding`_ member of the `Array metadata`_.

Note that this specification does not consider the case where the
chunk grid and the array space are not aligned at the origin vertices
of the array and the chunk at grid index (0, 0, 0, ...). However,
extensions may define variations on the regular grid type
such that the grid indices may include negative integers, and the
origin element of the array may occur at an arbitrary position within
any chunk, which is required to allow arrays to be extended by an
arbitrary length in a "negative" direction along any dimension.

.. note:: Chunks at the border of an array always have the full chunk size, even when
   the array only covers parts of it. For example, having an array with ``"shape": [30, 30]`` and
   ``"chunk_shape": [16, 16]``, the chunk ``0,1`` would also contain unused values for the indices
   ``0-16, 30-31``. When writing such chunks it is recommended to use the current fill value
   for elements outside the bounds of the array.

Chunk encoding
==============

Chunks are encoded into a binary representation for storage in a store_, using
the chain of codecs_ specified by the ``codecs`` metadata field.

Codecs
------

An array_ may be associated with a list of *codecs*.  Each codec specifies a
bidirectional transform (an *encode* transform and a *decode* transform).

Each codec has an *encoded representation* and a *decoded representation*;
each of these two representations are defined to be either:

- a multi-dimensional array of some shape and data type, or
- a byte string.

Logically, a codec ``c`` must define three properties:

- ``c.compute_encoded_representation_type(decoded_representation_type)``, a
  procedure that determines the encoded representation based on the decoded
  representation and any codec parameters.  In the case of a decoded
  representation that is a multi-dimensional array, the shape and data type
  of the encoded representation must be computable based only on the shape
  and data type, but not the actual element values, of the encoded
  representation.  If the ``decoded_representation_type`` is not supported,
  this algorithm must fail with an error.

- ``c.encode(decoded_value)``, a procedure that computes the encoded
  representation, and is used when writing an array.

- ``c.decode(encoded_value, decoded_representation_type)``, a procedure that
  computes the decoded representation, and is used when reading an array.

If more than one codec is specified for an array, each codec is applied
sequentially; when encoding, the encoded output of codec ``i`` serves as the
decoded input of codec ``i+1``, and similarly when decoding, the decoded
output of codec ``i+1`` serves as the encoded input to codec ``i``.


Determination of encoded representations
----------------------------------------

To encode or decode a chunk, the encoded and decoded representations for each
codec in the chain must first be determined as follows:

1. The initial decoded representation, ``decoded_representation[0]`` is a
   multi-dimensional array with the same data type as the zarr array, and shape
   equal to the chunk shape.

2. For each codec ``i``, the encoded representation is equal to the decoded
   representation ``decoded_representation[i+1]`` of the next codec, and is
   computed from
   ``codecs[i].compute_encoded_representation_type(decoded_representation[i])``.
   If ``compute_encoded_representation_type`` fails because of an incompatible
   decoded representation, an implementation should indicate an error.

.. _default-array-byte-string-conversion:

Conversion between multi-dimensional array and byte string representations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some codecs operate directly on multi-dimensional arrays of elements,
e.g. encoding a 3-d array as a multi-channel jpeg image.  Other codecs operate
at the byte level, e.g. gzip compression.  If a codec that operates at the byte
level receives as input an array that is not a 1-dimensional uint8 array, it may
convert the input array to a byte string by concatenating the default binary
representations of each element in lexicographical order (C order).  Similarly,
if a codec that expects a multi-dimensional array as input instead receives a
byte string, it may decode each element in lexicographical order according to
the default binary representation of each element.

.. note::

   To encode elements in a different order than the default lexicographical
   order (C order/row major), the :ref:`transpose codec<transpose-codec-v1>` may
   be specified.

Encoding procedure
------------------

Based on the computed ``decoded_representations`` list, a chunk is encoded using
the following procedure:

1. The initial *encoded chunk* ``EC[0]`` of the type specified by
   ``decoded_representation[0]`` is equal to the chunk array ``A`` (with a shape
   equal to the chunk shape, and data type equal to the zarr array data type).

2. For each codec ``codecs[i]`` in ``codecs``, ``EC[i+1] :=
   codecs[i].encode(EC[i])``.

3. The final encoded chunk representation ``EC_final`` is always a byte string.
   If ``EC[codecs.length]`` is a byte string, then ``EC_final :=
   EC[codecs.length]``.  Otherwise, ``EC_final`` is
   :ref:`converted<default-array-byte-string-conversion>` from
   ``EC[codecs.length]``.

4. ``EC_final`` is written to the store_.

Decoding procedure
------------------

Based on the computed ``decoded_representations`` list, a chunk is encoded using
the following procedure:

1. The encoded chunk representation ``EC_final`` is read from the store_.

2. If ``codecs[codecs.length]`` is a byte string, ``EC[codecs.length] :=
   EC_final``.  Otherwise, ``EC[codecs.length]`` is
   :ref:`converted<default-array-byte-string-conversion>` from ``EC_final``.

3. For each codec ``codecs[i]`` in ``codecs``, iterating in reverse order,
   ``EC[i] := codecs[i].decode(EC[i+1], decoded_representation[i])``.

4. The chunk array ``A`` is equal to ``EC[0]``.

Specifying codecs
-----------------

To allow for flexibility to define and implement new codecs, this
specification does not define any codecs, nor restrict the set of
codecs that may be used. Each codec must be defined via a separate
specification. In order to refer to codecs in array metadata
documents, each codec must have a unique identifier, which is a URI
that dereferences to a human-readable specification of the codec. A
codec specification must declare the codec identifier, and describe
(or cite documents that describe) the encoding and decoding algorithms
and the format of the encoded data.

A codec may have configuration parameters which modify the behaviour
of the codec in some way. For example, a compression codec may have a
compression level parameter, which is an integer that affects the
resulting compression ratio of the data. Configuration parameters must
be declared in the codec specification, including a definition of how
configuration parameters are represented as JSON.

The Zarr core development team maintains a repository of codec
specifications, which are hosted alongside this specification in the
`zarr-specs GitHub repository`_, and which are
published on the `zarr-specs documentation Web site
<https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/>`_. For ease of discovery, it is
recommended that codec specifications are contributed to the
zarr-specs GitHub repository. However, codec specifications may be
maintained by any group or organisation and published in any location
on the Web. For further details of the process for contributing a
codec specification to the zarr-specs GitHub repository, see the Zarr
community process specification.

Further details of how codecs are configured for an array are given in the `Array metadata`_ section.

Stores
======

A Zarr store is a system that can be used to store and retrieve data
from a Zarr hierarchy. For a store to be compatible with this
specification, it must support a set of operations defined in the `Abstract store
interface`_ subsection. The store interface can be implemented using a
variety of underlying storage technologies, described in the
subsection on `Store implementations`_.

Additionally, a store should specify a canonical URI format that can be used to
identify nodes in this store. Implementations should use the specified formats
when opening a Zarr hierarchy to automatically determine the appropriate store.

.. _abstract-store-interface:

Abstract store interface
------------------------

The store interface is intended to be simple to implement using a
variety of different underlying storage technologies. It is defined in
a general way here, but it should be straightforward to translate into
a software interface in any given programming language. The goal is
that an implementation of this specification could be modular and
allow for different store implementations to be used.

The store interface defines a set of operations involving `keys` and
`values`. In the context of this interface, a `key` is any string
containing only characters in the ranges ``a-z``, ``A-Z``, ``0-9``, or
in the set ``/.-_``, where the final character is **not** a ``/``
character. In general, a `value` is a sequence of bytes. Specific stores
may choose more specific storage formats, which must be stated in the
specification of the respective store. E.g. a database store might
encode values of ``*.json`` keys with a database-native json type.

It is assumed that the store holds (`key`, `value`) pairs, with only
one such pair for any given `key`. I.e., a store is a mapping from
keys to values. It is also assumed that keys are case sensitive, i.e.,
the keys "foo" and "FOO" are different.

To read and write partial values, a `range` specifies two integers
`range_start` and `range_length`, that specify a part of the value
starting at byte `range_start` (inclusive) and having a length of
`range_length` bytes. `range_length` may be none, indicating all
available data until the end of the referenced value. For example
`range` ``[0, none]`` specifies the full value. Stores that do not
support partial access can still fulfill partial requests by first extracting
the full value and then returning a subset of bytes.

The store interface also defines some operations involving
`prefixes`. In the context of this interface, a prefix is a string
containing only characters that are valid for use in `keys` and ending
with a trailing ``/`` character.

The store operations are grouped into three sets of capabilities:
**readable**, **writeable** and **listable**. It is not necessary for
a store implementation to support all of these capabilities.

A **readable store** supports the following operations:


``get`` - Retrieve the `value` associated with a given `key`.

    | Parameters: `key`
    | Output: `value`

``get_partial_values`` - Retrieve possibly partial `values` from given `key_ranges`.

    | Parameters: `key_ranges`: ordered set of `key`, `range` pairs,
    |   a `key` may occur multiple times with different `ranges`
    | Output: list of `values`, in the order of the `key_ranges`, may contain none
    |   for missing keys

A **writeable store** supports the following operations:

``set`` - Store a (`key`, `value`) pair.

    | Parameters: `key`, `value`
    | Output: none

``set_partial_values`` - Store `values` at a given `key`, starting at byte `range_start`.

    | Parameters: `key_start_values`: set of `key`,
    |   `range_start`, `value` triples, a `key` may occur multiple
    |   times with different `range_starts`, `range_starts` with
    |   length of the respective `value` must not specify overlapping
    |   ranges for the same `key`
    | Output: none

``erase`` - Erase the given key/value pair from the store.

    | Parameters: `key`
    | Output: none

``erase_values`` - Erase the given key/value pairs from the store.

    | Parameters: `keys`: set of `keys`
    | Output: none

``erase_prefix`` - Erase all keys with the given prefix from the store:

    | Parameter: `prefix`
    | Output: none

.. note::

   Some KV stores do allow creation and update of keys, but not deletion. For
   example, Zip archives do not allow removal of content without recreating the
   full archive.

   Inability to delete can affect ability to rename keys as well, as a rename
   is often a sequence or atomic combination of a deletion and a creation.

A **listable store** supports any one or more of the following
operations:

``list`` - Retrieve all `keys` in the store.

    | Parameters: none
    | Output: set of `keys`

``list_prefix`` - Retrieve all keys with a given prefix.

    | Parameters: `prefix`
    | Output: set of `keys` with the given `prefix`,

    For example, if a store contains the keys "a/b", "a/c/d" and
    "e/f/g", then ``list_prefix("a/")`` would return "a/b" and "a/c/d".

    Note: the behavior of ``list_prefix`` is undefined if ``prefix`` does not end
    with a trailing slash ``/`` and the store can assume there is at least one key
    that starts with ``prefix``.

``list_dir`` - Retrieve all keys and prefixes with a given prefix and
which do not contain the character "/" after the given prefix.

    | Parameters: `prefix`
    | Output: set of `keys` and set of `prefixes`

    For example, if a store contains the keys "a/b", "a/c", "a/d/e",
    "a/f/g", then ``list_dir("a/")`` would return keys "a/b" and "a/c"
    and prefixes "a/d/" and "a/f/". ``list_dir("b/")`` would return
    the empty set.


Note that because keys are case sensitive, it is assumed that the
operations ``set("foo", a)`` and ``set("FOO", b)`` will result in two
separate (key, value) pairs being stored. Subsequently ``get("foo")``
will return *a* and ``get("FOO")`` will return *b*.

It is recommended that the implementation of the
``get_partial_values``, ``set_partial_values`` and
``erase_values`` methods is made optional, providing fallbacks
for them by default. However, it is recommended to supply those operations
where possible for efficiency. Also, the ``get``, ``set`` and ``erase``
can easily be mapped onto their `partial_values` counterparts.
Therefore, it is also recommended to supply fallbacks for those if the
`partial_values` operations can be implemented.
An entity containing those fallbacks could be named ``StoreWithPartialAccess``.

Store implementations
---------------------

(This subsection is not normative.)

A store implementation maps the abstract operations of the store
interface onto concrete operations on some underlying storage
system. This specification does not constrain or make any assumptions
about the nature of the underlying storage system. Thus it is possible
to implement the store interface in a variety of different ways.

For example, a store implementation might use a conventional file
system as the underlying storage system, mapping keys onto file paths
and values onto file contents. The ``get`` operation could then be
implemented by reading a file, the ``set`` operation implemented by
writing a file, and the ``list_dir`` operation implemented by listing
a directory.

For example, a store implementation might use a key-value database
such as BerkeleyDB or LMDB as the underlying storage system. In this
case the implementation of ``get`` and ``set`` operations would be
whatever native operations are provided by the
database for getting and setting key/value pairs. Such a store
implementation might natively support the ``list`` operation but might
not support ``list_prefix`` or ``list_dir``, although these could be
implemented via ``list`` with post-processing of the returned keys.

For example, a store implementation might use a cloud object storage
service such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage
as the underlying storage system, mapping keys to object names and
values to object contents. The store interface operations would then
be implemented via concrete operations of the service's REST API,
i.e., via HTTP requests. E.g., the ``get`` operation could be
implemented via an HTTP GET request to an object URL, the ``set``
operation could be implemented via an HTTP PUT request to an object
URL, and the list operations could be implemented via an HTTP GET
request to a bucket URL (i.e., listing a bucket).

The examples above are meant to be illustrative only, and other
implementations are possible. This specification does not attempt to
standardise any store implementations, however where a store
implementation is expected to be widely used then it is recommended to
create a store implementation spec and contribute it to the `zarr-specs GitHub repository`_.
For an example of a store implementation spec, see the
:ref:`file-system-store-v1` specification.


Storage
=======

This section describes how to translate high level operations to
create, erase or modify Zarr hierarchies, groups or arrays, into low
level operations on the key/value store interface defined above.

In this section a "hierarchy path" is a logical path which identifies
a group or array node within a Zarr hierarchy, and a "storage key" is
a key used to store and retrieve data via the store interface. There
is a further distinction between "metadata keys" which are storage
keys used to store metadata documents, and "chunk keys" which are
storage keys used to store encoded chunks.

Note that any non-root hierarchy path will have ancestor paths that
identify ancestor nodes in the hierarchy. For example, the path
"/foo/bar" has ancestor paths "/foo" and "/".


Operations
----------

The following section describes possible operations of an implementation as a
non-normative guide-line.

Let `P` be an arbitrary hierarchy path.

Let ``meta_key(P)`` be the metadata key for `P`, ``P/zarr.json``.

Let ``data_key(P, j, i ...)`` be the data key for `P` for the chunk
with grid coordinates (`j`, `i`, ...).

Let "+" be the string concatenation operator.


**Create a group**

    To create an explicit group at hierarchy path `P`, perform
    ``set(meta_key(P), value)``, where `value` is the
    serialization of a valid group metadata document.

    Creating a group at path `P` implies
    the existence of groups at all ancestor paths of `P`.

**Create an array**

    To create an array at hierarchy path `P`, perform
    ``set(meta_key(P), value)``, where `value` is the serialisation of a valid
    array metadata document.

    Creating an array at path `P` implies the existence of groups at all
    ancestor paths of `P`.

**Store chunk data in an array**

    To store chunk data in an array at path `P` and chunk coordinate (`j`, `i`,
    ...), perform ``set(data_key(P, j, i, ...), value)``, where `value` is the
    serialisation of the corresponding chunk, encoded according to the
    information in the array metadata stored under the key ``meta_key(P)``.

**Retrieve chunk data in an array**

    To retrieve chunk data in an array at path `P` and chunk coordinate (`i`,
    `j`, ...), perform ``get(data_key(P, j, i, ...), value)``. The returned
    value is the serialisation of the corresponding chunk, encoded according to
    the array metadata stored at ``meta_key(P)``.

**Discover children of a group**

    To discover the children of a group at hierarchy path `P`, perform
    ``list_dir(P + "/")``. Any returned prefix ``Q`` not starting with ``__``
    indicates a child array or group. To determine whether the child is
    an array or group, the document ``meta_key(Q)`` must be checked.

    For example, if a group is created at path "/foo/bar" and an array
    is created at path "/foo/baz/qux", then the store will contain the
    keys "foo/bar/zarr.json" and "foo/baz/qux/zarr.json".
    Groups at paths "/", "/foo" and "/foo/baz" have not been explicitly
    created but are implied by their descendants. To list the children
    of the group at path "/foo", perform ``list_dir("/foo/")``,
    which will return the prefixes "foo/bar" and "foo/baz".
    From this it can be inferred that child groups or arrays
    "/foo/bar" and "/foo/baz" are present.

    If a store does not support any of the list operations then discovery of
    group children is not possible, and the contents of the hierarchy must be
    communicated by some other means, such as via an extension (see
    https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/15) or via some out of
    band communication.

**Discover all nodes in a hierarchy**

    To discover all nodes in a hierarchy, one should discover the children of
    the root of the hierarchy and then recursively list children of child
    groups.
    
    For hierarchies without group storage transformers one may also call
    ``list_prefix("/")``. All ``zarr.json`` keys represent either explicit
    groups or arrays. All intermediate prefixes ending in a ``/`` are implicit
    groups.

**Erase a group or array**

    To erase an array at path `P`, erase the metadata document and array data
    for the array, ``erase_prefix(P + "/")``.

    To erase an explicit or implicit group at path `P`: erase all nodes under
    this group and its metadata document - it should be sufficient to perform
    ``erase_prefix(P + "/")``

**Determine if a node exists**

    To determine if a node exists at path ``P``, try in the following order

    - ``get(meta_key(P))``
      (success implies an array or explicit group at ``P``);
    - ``list_dir(P + "/")``
      (non-empty result set implies an implicit group at ``P``).

    .. note::
        For listable stores, ``list_dir(parent(P))`` can be an alternative.


Storage transformers
====================

A Zarr storage transformer allows to change the zarr-compatible data before storing it.
The stored transformed data is restored to its original state whenever data is requested
by the Array. Storage transformers can be configured per array via the
:ref:`storage_transformers<storage_transformers_array>` name in the `array metadata`_. Storage transformers which do
not change the storage layout (e.g. for caching) may be specified at runtime without
adding them to the array metadata.

.. note::
    It is planned to add storage transformers also to groups in a later revision
    of this spec, see https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/215.

A storage transformer serves the same `abstract store interface`_ as the store_.
However, it should not persistently store any information necessary to restore the original data,
but instead propagates this to the next storage transformer or the final store.
From the perspective of an array or a previous stage transformer both store and storage transformer follow the same
protocol and can be interchanged regarding the protocol. The behaviour can still be different,
e.g. requests may be cached or the form of the underlying data can change.

Storage transformers may be stacked to combine different functionalities:

.. mermaid::

    graph LR
      Array --> t1
      subgraph stack [Storage transformers]
        t1[Transformer 1] --> t2[...] --> t3[Transformer N]
      end
      t3 --> Store

A fixed set of storage providers is recommended for implementation with this specification:


.. _extensions_section:

Extension points
================


Different types of extensions can exist and they can be grouped as follows:

=========== ======================= =======================================================
level       extension               metadata
=========== ======================= =======================================================
array       data type               `data_type`_
array       chunk grid              `chunk_grid`_
array       chunk key encoding      `chunk_key_encoding`_
array       codecs                  `codecs`_
array       storage transformer     :ref:`storage_transformers<storage_transformers_array>`
=========== ======================= =======================================================

If such extension points are used by groups or arrays, they are required, except
for data types specifying fallback data types.

See https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/49 for a list of
potential extensions.

Specifications for new extensions are recommended to be published in the
https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs repository via the
`ZEP process <https://zarr.dev/zeps/active/ZEP0000.html>`_. If a specification
is published decentralized (e.g. for initial experimentation or due to a very
specialized scope), it must use a URL in the `name` key of its metadata, which
identifies the publishing organization or individual, and should point to the
specification of the extension.

Future versions of this specification may also add new core features by adding new top-level
metadata keys. Such features are required by default. However, if the value of an unknown feature
is an object containing the key-value pair ``"must_understand": false``, it can be ignored.

Implementation Notes
====================

This section is non-normative and presents notes from implementers about cases
that need to be carefully considered but do not strictly fall into the spec.

Explicit vs implicit group
--------------------------

While this zarr spec v3 defines implicit and explicit groups, implementations may
decide to create an explicit group for all implicit groups they encounter; in
particular when using a hierarchical storage.

Erasure of an implicit group may automatically erase any empty parent. For
example on a S3 store where the namespace is flat, erasure of the last key with
a prefix will erase all the implicit group in the prefix.

Care must thus be taken when erasing an array or a group if the parent needs to
be converted into an explicit group.

A race-condition arises if a client writes an array at path ``P``,
and another concurrently assumes ``P`` is an implicit group and writes subgroups or arrays into it.
Implementations may choose to never use implicit groups to avoid this.

Resizing
--------

In general, arrays can be resized for writable (and if necessary deletable)
stores. In the most basic case, two scenarios can be considered, shrinking along
an array dimension, or increasing its size.

When shrinking, implementations can consider to delete chunks if the store
allows this, or keep them. This should either be configurable, or be
communicated to the user appropriately.

When increasing an array along a dimension, chunks may or may not have existed
in the new area. For areas where no chunks existed previously, they implicitly
have the fill value after updating the metadata, no new chunks need to be
written in this case. Previous partial chunks will contain the fill value at the
time of writing them by default. If there was chunk data in the new area which
was not deleted when shrinking the array, this data will be shown by default.
The latter case should be signalled to the user appropriately. An implementation
can also allow the user to choose to delete previous data explicitly when
increasing the array (by writing the fill value into partial chunks and deleting
others), but this should not be the default behavior.


Comparison with Zarr v2
=======================

This section is informative.

Below is a summary of the key differences between this specification
(v3) and Zarr v2.

- v3 has explicit support for extensions via defined
  `extension points_` and mechanisms.

- v3 uses ``zarr.json`` files for specifying core metadata of groups and arrays
  as well as user attributes instead of ``.zgroup``, ``.zarray`` and ``.zattrs``.

- v3 has a different metadata_ schema to accommodate the extension points.

- v3 introduces `storage transformers_`, which transform reads and writes between
  array and store.

- v3 introduces chainable codecs_ to unify the codec and filter concepts of v2.

- The default chunk keys have changed from ``0.1.2`` to ``c/0/1/2``. The v2-style
  chunk keys are still available through the ``"v2"`` `chunk_key_encoding_`.

- v3 allows for greater flexibility in how groups and arrays are
  created. In particular, v3 supports implicit groups, which are
  groups that do not have a metadata document but whose existence is
  implied by descendant nodes. This change enables multiple arrays to
  be created in parallel without generating race conditions for the
  metadata when creating parent groups.

- The set of `core data types_` specified in v3 is less than in v2. Additional
  data types will be defined via extensions.
