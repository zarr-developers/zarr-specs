Description
===========

The ``configuration`` object may contain one optional member,
``separator``, which must be either ``"/"`` or ``"."``.  If not specified,
``separator`` defaults to ``"/"``.

The key for a chunk with grid index (``k``, ``j``, ``i``, ...) is
formed by taking the initial prefix ``c``, and appending for each dimension:

- the ``separator`` character, followed by,

- the ASCII decimal string representation of the chunk index within that dimension.

For example, in a 3 dimensional array, with a separator of ``/`` the identifier
for the chunk at grid index (1, 23, 45) is the string ``"c/1/23/45"``.  With a
separator of ``.``, the identifier is the string ``"c.1.23.45"``. The initial prefix 
``c`` ensures that metadata documents and chunks have separate prefixes.

.. note:: A main difference with spec v2 is that the default chunk separator
    changed from ``.`` to ``/``, as in N5.  This decreases the maximum number of
    items in hierarchical stores like directory stores.

.. note:: Arrays may have 0 dimensions (when for example representing scalars),
    in which case the coordinate of a chunk is the empty tuple, and the chunk key
    will consist of the string ``c``.
