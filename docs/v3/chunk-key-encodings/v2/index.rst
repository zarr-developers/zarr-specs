Description
===========

The ``configuration`` object may contain one optional member,
``separator``, which must be either ``"/"`` or ``"."``.  If not specified,
``separator`` defaults to ``"."``.

The identifier for chunk with at least one dimension is formed by
concatenating for each dimension:

 - the ASCII decimal string representation of the chunk index within that
   dimension, followed by

 - the ``separator`` character, except that it is omitted for the last
   dimension.

For example, in a 3 dimensional array, with a separator of ``.`` the identifier
for the chunk at grid index (1, 23, 45) is the string ``"1.23.45"``.  With a
separator of ``/``, the identifier is the string ``"1/23/45"``.

For chunk grids with 0 dimensions, the single chunk has the key ``"0"``.

.. note::

    This encoding is intended only to allow existing v2 arrays to be
    converted to v3 without having to rename chunks.  It is not recommended
    to be used when writing new arrays.
